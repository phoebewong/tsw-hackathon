This Shiny app is created by Phoebe Wong, Primary Research Analyst at [Legendary Applied Analytics](https://legendaryappliedanalytics.com/), the analytics division under [Legendary Pictures](https://www.legendary.com/) (yes, the movie company that produced Jurassic World, Interstellar, Inception, The Dark Knight Trilogy and more). 

I built this app for fun and as a proof of concept, but I would love to have your comments and feedback, feel free to reach out!

## Potential Improvements

If I have the opportunity in the future, I hope to:

1. Incorporate Microsoft API (In fact, I tried and failed... but I will be back!)

2. Add variables: Meeting Status (Accepted, Rejected, Tentative), because people do not necessarily accept/attend to all meeting invites they received. The output will be more meaningful if it truly reflects your meeting history based on the Meeting Status.
