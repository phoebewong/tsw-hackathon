# Visualize Microsoft Outlook Meeting Data in Shiny
This is a repository of my Shiny application that visualizes Microsoft Outlook Calendar Data.

The [application](https://phoebewong.shinyapps.io/calendar_shinyio/) is presented at [useR! 2017](https://www.user2017.brussels/uploads/2017_useR_Shiny_Outlook_Calendarv2.pdf) in Brussels, Belgium.

I built this app for fun and as a proof of concept, but I would love to have your comments and feedback, feel free to reach out!
