Introduction
=======================

## When sex hurts, women often feel alone-but they're not. 
## About 30 percent of women report pain during vaginal intercourse, according to a 2015 study in the [Journal of Sexual Medicine](https://pelvicpain.org/docs/patients/pelvicfloordysfunction-english.aspx) which surveyed a subsample of 1,738 women.

**Pelvic Floor Dysfunction**: The pelvic floor is a network of muscles, ligaments, and tissues that act like a hammock to support the organs of the pelvis: the uterus, vagina, bladder, urethra, and rectum.

**Symptoms**: The most common symptom is a feeling of either pain (sometimes sharp) or a heaviness/pressure in the area of the vagina and lower abdomen. Symptoms tend to occur when women are upright, straining, or coughing and disappear when they are lying down and relaxing. For some women, sexual intercourse is painful. Dysfunction in the pelvic floor can affect the bladder and rectum. As a result, women with PFD can have problems with urination (having to go frequently, trouble starting to urinate), or problems having a bowel movement (difficulty going, constipation).

**Treatment**: Pelvic floor physical therapy is a non-surgical procedure done by a physical therapist. The therapist applies pressure and stretching techniques to the pelvic floor muscles. She also trains the patient to control the pelvic floor muscles. Medications in the form of muscle relaxants and vaginal suppositories can be given in low doses for short durations to relax the pelvic muscles. 

### Too many women have painful sex and not enough doctors know how to treat it; we provide the resources and treatment options so women can get back to enjoying sex.
